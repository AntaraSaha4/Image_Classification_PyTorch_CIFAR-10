# Image_Classification_PyTorch_CIFAR-10
Image Classification with PyTorch on CIFAR-10 Dataset
1. Perform image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset containing 60000 images belonging to 10 different classes. 
2. Trained three classifier models using PyTorch, which include a logistic regression model and two convolutional network architectures, LeNet and AlexNet.
3. Performed hyperparameter tuning on AlexNet and achieve 72% accuracy.
4. Deployed the final AlexNet model to an Azure API endpoint.
